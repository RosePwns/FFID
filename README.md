### A script to fuzz websites for information disclosures.
Latest implementations:
  1.  Implement multithreading to speed up the fuzzing process and increase the number of requests per second.
  2.  Use a smarter wordlist or wordlist generator that includes common file and directory names, as well as different file extensions.
  3.  Implement an option to include common HTTP headers (e.g. User-Agent, Referer, Cookie) in requests to simulate real user traffic.
  4.  Implement an option to use a proxy server to hide the origin IP address and avoid getting blocked by the target server.
